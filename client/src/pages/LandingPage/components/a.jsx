//         TextureForge is a web-app designed to simplify the process of creating texture maps for game development, 3D renders,
//         and VFX projects, streamlining typical workflows for managing PBR<sup style="font-size: smaller;">1</sup>
//         materials by offering a straightforward, free way to generate them directly within the browser.
//         <br />
//         <br />
//         The site employs a practical, intuitive interface that leverages Stable Diffusion (an open-source generative AI model) to create the images,
//         ensuring that users can quickly get the materials they need with a minimum level of input and without having to compromise on quality or spend time
//         (and money) using proprietary software.
//         <br />
//         <br />
//         To use the service, a user can simply input a description matching the material they want (via the site's 'Forge' page), click submit, and wait
//         for their prompt to be processed.
//         <br />
//         Meanwhile, under the hood TextureForge will take the user's description, translate it into a prompt optimally
//         formatted for Stable Diffusion, and send it to SD for evaluation<sup style="font-size: smaller;">2</sup>.
//         <br />
//         After the textures load, they can then be previewed directly in the browser, downloaded using filenames structured for easy management, and imported into the user's 3D program of choice.
//         <br />
//         <br />
//         As a platform, TextureForge was designed in the name of efficiency, accessibility, and elasticity, aiming to provide digital artists and game developers
//         with a user-friendly, handy time-saver to generate and manage their materials. <br />
//         It was built for projects at various stages of development, but especially those where it makes sense to prioritize speed,
//         resource management, and lower-fidelity renders over photorealistic lighting and maximum resolution.
