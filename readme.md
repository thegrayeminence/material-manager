# ShaderProxy: Generate Placeholder Materials for PBR Workflows 
>render texture maps for your materials procedurally or via AI prompts and pre-existing assets; configure your materialsâ€™ structure; and preview your materials in the browser before 

ShaderProxy USES DATA INPUTS TO GENERATE MATERIALS THAT can be used to ACT AS LOW IMPACT/Temporary PLACEHOLDERS FOR PBR MATERIALs; by mimicking the file structure and color information of true PBR materials, users can slot their proxies (i.e. generated texture maps) into their rendering engine's  shader system/node tree as they normally would PLACEHOLDERS IN SOFTWARE/RENDERING ENGINES; thus providing a handy time-saving device for animators/artsits still in the early stage of developing their projects--previz, playblasts, or quick renders where the prioritization of speed and low-impact assets over photorealistic lighting is desirable.

## The Solution:

## Built With:

## Getting Started:

### User Instructions:

### Developer Instructions:

### Server/Client Setup:

#### For Server Setup, Run The Following In Your Terminal:

   ```shell
   brew services start postgresql
   cd server
   pipenv install && pipenv shell
   export FLASK_APP=app.py && export FLASK_RUN_PORT=3001 && export FLASK_DEBUG=1
   export DATABASE_URL='postgresql://username:password@hostname/dbname'
   flask db upgrade
   flask run
   ```

#### If you need to flush/reset the SQL database, run:

   ```shell
   brew services start postgresql
   psql postgres
   DROP DATABASE your_database_name;
   CREATE DATABASE your_new_database_name;
   ```

##### For Setting Up the Frontend:
   ```shell
   cd client
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
#### For configuring Stable Diffusion/Replicate Client:
- Sign up for account on [Replicate](https://replicate.com), generate an API token, and store the token's text locally in .env and then reference the token's value in the main app.py file 
- To find new models/forked versions of Stable Diffusion, visit Replicate's site and import them into the app.py's replicate.run(...) function to create surprising results; just make sure the new models' input and ouput schema match those used in the code!
